# Project-1-Example-Navidson
An example project for Internet Technologies II - inspired by Mark Danielewski's House of Leaves

This site serves as an example for Project 1, in which you should create a static site using standard HTML and CSS.

Overall, this site is relatively simple, although it does use some keyframe animations, and manipulates the transform properties of some elements.
