                <p><em><strong>T</strong>he Navidson Record</em> actually contains two films: the one Navidson made, which everyone remembers, and the one he set out to make, which very few people ever detect. While easily overshadowed by the finished film, the filmmaker's original intentions provide an early context in which to view the peculiar properties of the <span class="house">house</span> later on.</p>
                <!-- As in the book, the word house is always blue, so I'm using a span class here for that. -->
                <p>In many ways, the opening of <em>The Navidson Record</em>, shot back in April of 1990, remains one of the more disturbing sequences because it so effectively denies itself even the slightest premonition about what will soon take place on Ash Tree Lane.</p>
                
                <p>Not once during those initial minutes does Navidson indicate he knows anything about the impending nightmare he and his entire family are about to face. He is wholly innocent, and the nature of the <span class="house">house</span>, at least for a little while, lies beyond his imagination let alone his suspicions.</p>

                <!-- Here I'm using the <sup> tag which indicates a superscript. Useful for citations and equations, etc... -->
                <p>Of course not everyone remains in accordance with this assessment. Dr. Isaiah Rosen believes, "Navidson's a fraud from frame one and his early posturing puts the entire work at risk."<sup>10</sup> Rosen assumes the beginning is just a case of "bad acting" performed by a man who has already envisioned the rest of the film. Consequently Rosen seriously undervalues the importance of Navidson's initial intentions.</p>
                
                <p>All too often major discoveries are the unintended outcome of experiments or explorations aimed at achieving entirely different results. In Navidson's case, it is impossible to disregard his primary goal, especially since it served as progenitor or at the very least the "near origin" to all that followed. Rosen's presumptions<sup>11</sup> lead him to dismiss the cause for the result, thereby losing sight of the complex and rewarding relationship which exists between the two.</p>

                    Not every cave search has a Terry Tarkington who knows the cave like his own home.

                    <p><strong>W</strong>hen Navidson and Reston finally reach the foot of the stairway, Tom is not there.</p>

                    <p>It is almost noon on the third day of the rescue attempt. Reston's gloves are torn; his hands blistered and bleeding. Wax's breathing is shallow and inconsistent. Jed's body weighs heavily on Navidson. All of which, bad as it is, is made even more unbearable when Navidson realizes his brother has not come down the stairs to meet them.</p>
                    
                    <p>For the final shot of this section, Navidson loads his Arriflex with a 100ft of high-speed tungsten, uses a five minute ultra high intensity lightstick to illuminate the area, and rolls his Hi 8 to record sound.</p>

                    <p>"For almost an hour," he begins. "I waited, rested, kept hoping something would change. It didn't. Eventually I started going over my stuff, trying to figure out what exactly to do next. Then all of a sudden I heard something clatter behind me. I turned around and there lying on the floor, just off to the side here, was the third quarter. [He holds up the coin] If Tom dropped it say a few minutes after Reston reaced the top, then it's been falling for at least fifty minutes. I'm too muddled to do the math but it doesn't take a genius to realize I'm an impossible distance down."<sup>251</sup></p>

                    <p>"I don't know how I'm going to get back. The radio's dead. If I can find my pack and Jed's, I'll have water and food for at least three days with maybe four days worth of batteries. But what will that do? <em>Non gratum anus rodentum</em>.<sup>254</sup> Hell."</p>
